Executive Director <br>
CGFS, BP, and S/GP</span><br><br>

<span class="EDStyle">
<p align="justify">Serving in a myriad of progressively challenging positions I have had the privilege of working with icons of the Foreign and Civil Service in Washington and Overseas.  Most recently, as Counselor for Management Affairs at U.S. Embassy Beirut, classified as a High Threat post, I managed a staff of 140, providing administrative services to State and other USG agencies and was acting Deputy Chief of Mission, as needed.</p><br>
<p align="justify">As Executive Director in the Bureau of Medical Services, I was involved with standing up seven Health Units and three Hospitals geographically dispersed in austere environments throughout Iraq to support U.S. personnel.  They were mission ready and on schedule at the time of the U.S. Military withdrawal.  I also negotiated and signed a major medico-legal agreement with the DOD concerning DNA testing and storage, identification and mortuary services around the globe.  I worked collaboratively on a telemedicine initiative with the U.S. Coast Guard to share resources for a state of the art Electronic Medical Records system, with anticipated savings of $12 million over five years.</p><br>
<p align="justify">Previously, as Principal Officer of U.S. Consulate General Dhahran, Saudi Arabia I was cited for building a dynamic team through a shared vision and gaining staff buy-in for the strategic agenda.  I developed a robust Pol/Econ reporting program, reached out to political and civic leaders, and was seen frequently in the media as the U.S. Representative in the Region.  I actively promoted the President's Export Initiative, bringing together U.S. companies and Host Country business leaders.  I also endorsed a dynamic program to attract Saudi students to attend American universities.  I initiated a vigorous Entry Level Officer mentoring program and improved the morale and welfare of the Consulate community.</p><br>
<p align="justify">In the Bureau of Economic, Energy, and Business Affairs as Executive Director I was responsible for overall management of the Bureau.  I helped launch the Economic Engagement Matrix for the benefit of the interagency community.  Some of my more noteworthy achievements as a Special Assistant to both the DCFO and A/S and CFO included serving on the management team that consolidated the Financial Management Center in Paris and the finance offices in Washington, relocating them to Charleston, SC.</p><br>
<p align="justify">In Russia as the senior Financial Management Officer (FMO) for State and thirty-four other USG agencies, I used my problem solving and team building skills in crisis situations to weather the crash of the ruble, intermittent political unrest, Y2K preparations, and the completion of the re-built, de-bugged Embassy.  With the Government of Russia I arranged for our LES to join the Social Insurance System and facilitated the withholding of taxes as a counter measure to their harassment by the FSB.  Serving as the FMO and Human Resources Officer in Kuwait, I played an active role in the enlargement of the USG presence in country, relocation to a new Embassy compound, and post liberation reconstruction.  Earlier in my career at State, I served at Embassy Rome as an FMO, as well as a Budget Analyst in the Bureau of Budget and Planning for two years.</p><br>
<p align="justify">Prior to the U.S. Department of State I worked for the U.S. Department of Energy, the management consulting firm of Booz Allen Hamilton, as well as for the multinational oil company of Saudi Aramco in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.  My professional career was launched with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) after graduating from university.</p><br>
<p align="justify">I have Bachelor Degrees (Magna Cum Laude) from the Catholic University of America in Accounting and Economics and an M.B.A. in Finance and International Business from The George Washington University.  In 2005, I received an M.S. degree in National Security Strategy from the National War College of the National Defense University.  I am the recipient of the Department's Superior Honor, MSIs, and Meritorious Honor Awards.  I am married to Sharon Boynton Kenny and we have two sons, Joseph and Patrick.</p><br>
